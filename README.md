AI-Face-Mask-Detector-Created by Akshaj Vishwanathan

Project Description:

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has wrecked havoc in the world with millions infected and many deaths due to the virus. Since it spreading medium is air and contact, it is paramount to maintain hygiene. Some ways are to keep cleanliness where you live and work, wash hands regularly etc. Another important thing to prevent its spreading is to wear a mask wherever we go, be it workplace area like offices or a place where a lot of people would be present like a hospital or mall etc. So this project aims to use computer vision to detect wether a person is wearing mask or not and alert him/her to wear a mask else he/she won't be allowed to enter the premises. This will not only promote contactless checking but also induces the thought of wearing a mask among the people near that area, so that they won't be denied entry. The project works on computer vision using customvision.ai of Microsoft Azure where a model would be trained using a face mask dataset and based on that it would detect if a person is wearing mask or not.
